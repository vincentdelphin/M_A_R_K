The stju-drone of this project depends on the hector_gazebo and hector_quadrotor packages for server messages used by the Sjtu drone. The stju-drone provides the simulated model for gazebo to emulate the M-A-R-K drone. Licensed under the GNU (General Public License V3.0)

The stju-drone repository is developed by Georg No, the repository is provided below:

The OpenAI drone_training package written by Ricardo Tellez is used as the basis for the reinforcement development of the project.

This project updates the drone_training package with necessary syntax changes and compiler interpreter modifications for the scripts to be nonconflicting with Python3:
